            About Me
        </p>
        <p id="aboutParagraph1">I am a graduate software engineering student at Kennesaw State University with an expected graduation in May 2026. 
            My prior experience includes a bachelor's degree in software engineering and knowledge of web design, secure coding practices, 
            encryption fundamentals, and API design and implementation. My software engineering knowledge also includes thorough knowledge 
            of developing software test-cases including covering many edge-cases that others may miss. I take pride in my problem solving 
            abilities and apply them to the software that I create. 
    
        </p>
        <br>
        <p id="aboutParagraph2">
            I have over a decade of automotive diagnostic and repair experience, mainly focusing on Lexus and Tesla vehicles. With advanced knowledge of automotive Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) including self-driving and automatic braking applications, I've honed a problem-solving mindset and an eye for detail that translates seamlessly into the software world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p id="aboutParagraph3">
            Beyond the code, I’m an outdoor enthusiast who loves running, biking, and kayaking—activities that fuel my creativity and drive for continuous improvement. Whether it's building efficient systems or exploring new challenges, I thrive on finding refined solutions to complex problems.
